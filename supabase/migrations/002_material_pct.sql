-- 002: Material cost as a percentage of revenue, per team x customer line.
--
-- Cost of Materials (account 200000) is no longer typed directly on the
-- statement. Instead each revenue line (team x customer) carries a single
-- annual percentage; material cost for that line = revenue x pct, per month,
-- and rolls up to account 200000 through the budget_statement_lines view.

-- 1) Per-line annual percentage (e.g. 40.00 = 40% of that line's revenue).
alter table budget_revenue_lines
  add column if not exists material_pct numeric(6,2) not null default 0;

-- 2) New input_type so the statement renders 200000 as detail-driven (read-only).
alter table budget_accounts drop constraint if exists budget_accounts_input_type_check;
alter table budget_accounts add constraint budget_accounts_input_type_check
  check (input_type in ('direct', 'revenue', 'salary', 'cellphone', 'vehicle', 'material_pct'));

update budget_accounts set input_type = 'material_pct' where code = '200000';

-- Remove any previously typed direct values for 200000 so they can't double-count
-- with the percentage-derived amounts in the view.
delete from budget_lines
where account_id in (select id from budget_accounts where code = '200000');

-- 3) Rebuild the statement view with a material-cost branch.
--    Costs are stored negative, so material = -(revenue * pct/100).
